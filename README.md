# Real Estate Price Prediction using Python
Model for Price prediction in Real Estate using Machine Learning
This project demonstrates a machine learning approach to predicting real estate prices based on various features such as location, property size, number of rooms, and more. Using Python and popular data science libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, I have built and fine-tuned multiple models to accurately estimate property values.
Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features to prepare the dataset for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing trends and patterns in the data to gain insights into the factors influencing property prices.
Model Building: Implementing various regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to predict property prices.
Model Evaluation: Comparing model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to select the best model.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Using Grid Search and Cross-Validation to optimize model parameters for improved accuracy.
Deployment: Setting up the model for deployment using Flask, enabling real-time predictions on new data.
Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Flask (for deployment)
Objective:
The objective of this project is to build a robust model that can accurately predict real estate prices, providing valuable insights for both buyers and sellers in the real estate market.
